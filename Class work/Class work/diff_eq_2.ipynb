    "Real life problems frequently involve more than one dependent variable. Fortunately little about our previous Runge-Kutta approach needs to change to handle these problems.\n",

    "First, since we're using computers and we want to write flexible code, we'll turn our dependent variable into a list or array to account for the new term(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the function $f(\\vec{r}, t)$ will now compute both/all the relevant equations and return the appropriate list/array.\n",

    "\\frac{dx}{dt} = xy -x , \\qquad \\frac{dy}{dt} = y- xy + \\sin^2\\omega t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps beginning with previous code, write a program to solve these equations from $t=0$ to $t=10$ given $\\omega = 1$, with $ x = y = 0$ at $t=0$. Now that we know fourth-order Runge-Kutta is only a few more lines of code than simpler methods, it should be our first choice going forward."

The function to use for $f(\\vec{r}, t)$ and some constants are given as well. I've copied over the given code for you. Complete the exercise by adding the Runge-Kutta code and plotting."
