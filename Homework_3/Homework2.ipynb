    "My function could take integers and floats as inputs. With the factorial of integer 200, I got a very large number, but python was able to compute and show it. With the factorial of the float of 200, python displayed it as infinite. This is probably because you are delaing with storing memory on both extremes of a number. The number itself is very large, but if you include the float, it also has a trail of decimals that are getting multiplied. So, in the end, Python cannot store a number with that mcuh data in memory."
