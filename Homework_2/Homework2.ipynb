With the factorial of the float of 200, python displayed it as infinite. This is probably because you are delaing with storing memory on both extremes of a number. The number itself is very large, but if you include the float, it also has a trail of decimals that are getting multiplied. So, in the end, Python cannot store a number with that mcuh data in memory."
